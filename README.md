#WTFront-End

WTFront-End is a web app used to receive feedback on one simple question to the community:
>What is a front-end developer?

Take a look around at the various job boards and portfolio sites. You'll see just how mixed the definition gets.

- Do they lean more towards the design of the site or the development?
- Do they need to more than just HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript?
- Can they just replace the designers?
- What tools should they know the get hired as a Front-End Developer?

All this and more should be answered by hearing what the community thinks and creating discussions on the matter.
